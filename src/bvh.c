//README 
//A Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is a tree structure used in 3D graphics and ray tracing to speed up intersection tests. It groups objects into nested bounding boxes (volumes), so you can quickly discard large sets of objects that donâ€™t intersect a ray by testing their bounding boxes first. This reduces the number of expensive ray-object intersection tests, making rendering much faster. Each node in the BVH contains a bounding box that encloses all objects in its subtree, and the tree is built by recursively splitting objects based on their spatial distribution.

//PSEUDO 
// initialize, calculate bounding boxes for objects
// in a loop, recursively:		- create a node that contains all current objects (start with all) and a single AABB (axis aligned bounding box) entailing the current objects
//								- find division axis (the axis that has the most spread-out values, in this case the most difference between highest and lowest of e.g. y-value of the centrepoint for the y axis)
//								- sort the objects along this axis (e.g. by y-values)
//								- split them in half according to this order
//								- create node for both of these halfes
//								- repeat the process with(in) these nodes
// in the rendering loop, for each ray, check root bounding box intersection first, keep traversing the tree top-down, until you reach a(/multiple) leaf-nodes(objects) that the ray hits, only calculate intersection with this(/these) object(/s)
// this results in an efficiency of O(log(N)) instead of O(N)
// especially checking for intersections with bounding boxes is very cheap, so a lot of time can be saved.
